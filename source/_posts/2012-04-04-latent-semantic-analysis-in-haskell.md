Last weekend I decided to learn Haskell with [Francis Williams](http://fwilliams.org/). It was an epic adventure. Last night I implemented LSA - Latent Semantic Analysis using Haskell.

For those of you who are not enlightened: [LSA](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Latent_semantic_analysis) takes a list of documents, extracts terms from them, builds a [tf-idf](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tfidf) matrix, then compresses the matrix to build a lower dimensional approximation, to improve the speed and accuracy of measuring the similarity between documents. Sometimes, this is used in combination with clustering to group the documents into categories.

I want to point anyone interested in this towards the following resources that helped me do this:

- [The best Haskell tutorial on the internet](http://learnyouahaskell.com/)
- [The best description of LSA I've seen (python)](http://www.puffinwarellc.com/index.php/news-and-articles/articles/33-latent-semantic-analysis-tutorial.html)
- [Example of how to do SVD (singular value decomposition) in Haskell](http://journal.batard.info/post/2009/04/08/svd-fun-profit): 

In case anyone wants to do something similar themselves, here is the code I ended up with. Please let me know (email?) if I'm doing something stupid and I'll fix this up. I suspect that I am, considering how new I am to Haskell.
